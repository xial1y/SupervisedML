    "Beta Bank, due to the gradual leaving of their clients, is interested in creating a machine learning model that will predict whether a customer will leave or stay with the bank since it is cheaper to retain a customer than to find a new one. We are given a dataset with their clients' past behavior and contract terminatations that will be divided and used for model training and testing. The model that will be considered successful will need to have a testing set F1 score of at least 0.59. We are requested to compare the F1 score with the AUC-ROC metric. \n"

So there is a class imbalance since there is way more 0 answers than 1 and we will have to consider that when running and training the models. We can consider upsampling the minority class, which is 1 (clients who have exited) and making more instances of it so the amount of instances for '0' and '1' are more balance. Alternatively, we can go with downsampling where we will random discard some instances of '0's so that the differences between the two class is reduced. We should try both techniques on the models we will be building to see which one will give us the best score. "
